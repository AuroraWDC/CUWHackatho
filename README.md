# Welcome to the CUW Hackathon Spring 2023 sponsored by Aurora WDC! 

## Challenge overview

In this challenge, you will explore creating an equivalent to Buddyboss in Web3. Buddyboss is an advanced Wordpress plugin that allows to create online social communities (like Facebook, LinkedIn...etc.). We expect teams to spend sometime finding alternatives in the Web3 world that would be similar to [Buddyboss](https://www.buddyboss.com).

Teams are free to research current platforms 

## Steps for this Hackathon

* Fork this Repo and use your version as the code and documentation repository for the Web3 Social Media Platform you'll build (like [DiamondApp](https://diamondapp.com/browse?feedTab=Hot), [Steem](https://steem.com/) or whatever you'll be able to find)
* The Web3 or Decentralized Social Platform should have facility for the following:
  - Ability to create an account (with the option to sign-up using a wallet address like Metamask)
  - Ability to Post and interact with posts (Like, Reply, Share)
  - Ability to create and/or Join Groups
  - Ability to create events

Up to (3) teams will be chosen. The first team receive a price of $300 and the (2) runner-up teams receive $100 each.
